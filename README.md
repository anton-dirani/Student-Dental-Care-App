## 🏥 The Problem  

In Syrian universities, senior dental students are required to perform specific dental procedures, such as extractions and cleanings, under the supervision of dental professors as part of their semester grading. However, they face a significant challenge—locating patients with the appropriate dental conditions, as universities do not assist in this task.

## ✅ The Solution  

This app bridges the gap between dental students and patients:  

- **Students** can register, verify their identity with a student ID, and list the required treatments they need to perform. They also provide details such as supervising professors and the appointment dates.  
- **Patients** can register, describe their dental issues, and connect with suitable students for free treatment. They can book an appointment with a student based on availability and ratings from past patients.

## 🚀 Features  

### 🎓 Students  
-  Create, edit, and delete treatment posts  
-  Upload pictures and descriptions for treatments  
-  Report accounts (both students & patients)  
-  Update profile information (Current university and year of study)  

### 🏥 Patients  
-  Book appointments with students based on treatment availability  
-  Rate students after receiving treatment    

This app ensures students fulfill their academic requirements while providing patients with free dental care, making it a **win-win solution!** 🎉
